local tasks:
- lint (code validation)
- minify (strip whitespaces and comments from css, js)
- build css (variables for colors and breakpoints, do we need SASS?)

/*

Sass-lint can be configured from a .sass-lint.yml file in your project. If you don't have one in the root of your project or you would like all your projects to follow a standard config file then you can specify the path to one in your project's package.json file.
